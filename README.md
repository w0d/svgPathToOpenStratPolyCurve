# svgPathToOpenStratPolyCurve
This is a utility for the [openstrat](https://github.com/Rich2/openstrat) graphic/strategy library

To convert a SVG path to an openstrat PolyCurve

Try it out [here](https://w0d.github.io/svgPathToOpenStratPolyCurve/)

NB: Currently working almost for all svg-path commands (non circular Arcs may not be implemented until openstrat supports them)
