# svgPathToOpenStratShape
Converts a SVG path to an openstrat Shape

Currently working for most relative svg-path commands - though Arcs may not be implemented until either openstrat supports them



TODO:
Add the option to scale svg
Complete full set of relative commands (except Arcs) 
Add all absolute commands (the Capitols: M L H V etc)
Consider converting Arcs to Polyline or Beziers
