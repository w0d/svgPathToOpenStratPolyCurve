# svgPathToOpenStratPolyCurve
This is a utility for the [openstrat](https://github.com/Rich2/openstrat) graphic/strategy library

This project aims to offer the ability to convert a SVG path to an openstrat PolyCurve via a webpage - currently the focus is on generating PolyCurves ready for use in Flags

Try it out [here](https://w0d.github.io/svgPathToOpenStratPolyCurve/)

NB: Currently working almost for all svg-path commands (the exeption being non circular arcs which will be implemented when openstrat supports them)
